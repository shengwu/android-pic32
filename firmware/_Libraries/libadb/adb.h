//
// This module implements the ADB protocol (host side).
// It exposes a simple API that enables the client to open several independent
// communication channels with the remote side. These communication channels can
// correspond to virtual TCP ports on the remote side, a command shell, etc.
// Each such communication channel is able to process a single buffer of
// outgoing data at a given moment as well as calls back a client-provided
// function as soon as incoming data arrives.
// The number of concurrently open channels is limited by ADB_MAX_CHANNELS.
//
// Closing of a channel:
// ---------------------
// In case the channel opening is rejected by the remote end or closed by it
// later, the client will be notified by calling the channel's callback function
// with a NULL data buffer and a length of 0.
// Client may close a channel by calling the ADBClose() function.
//
// Error handling:
// ---------------
// This module automatically attempts to establish a connection with the remote
// end as soon as the USB layer is attached. When the underlying connection
// drops, the ADB connection will be dropped, and re-established when possible.
// The client should check the return code on every call to ADBTasks(). When the
// connection drops, all state is lost and any open channels are closed. They
// will be notified of the closure as mentioned in the above section.
// Upon detection of any sort of error or data corruption during connection,
// this module will reset the USB device and start over. Under normal operation
// this should never happen, so the client may want to reset everything and
// restart the program whenever a connection drops, but this is of course not
// required.
//
// Important note:
// ---------------
// The USB layer does not handle transmision of ROM buffers. Do not pass ROM
// buffers to ADBWrite(). When defining an array as const, the compiler
// typically stores it in ROM, so a possible workaround is to define it as non-
// const, even if it does not change.
//
// Usage example (error handling omitted):
// ---------------------------------------
// void ShellCallback(ADB_CHANNEL_HANDLE h, const void* data, UINT32 len) {
//   print(data, len);
// }
//
// ...
// while (!BootloaderTasks());
// h = ADBOpen("shell:", &ShellCallback);
// while (!ADBChannelReady(h)) {
//   BootloaderTasks();
// }
// ADBWrite(h, data, sizeof data);
// while (1) {
//   BootloaderTasks();
// }
