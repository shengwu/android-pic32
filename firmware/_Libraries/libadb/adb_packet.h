// This file implements a simple ADB packet transfer mechanism on top of the
// USB layer.
// It enables sending / receiving packets to/from an ADB device. At any given
// time there can be up to one pending transmit and one pending receive.
// API is asynchronous: client issues a request and can then poll its status.
// Client should periodically call ADBPacketTasks() in order to provide context
// for this layer.
//
// Buffer ownership and lifetime:
// ------------------------------
// When writing, client is responsible to keep the data buffer (if there is one)
// alive until the write operation completes.
// When reading, the returned data buffer is not owned by the client, and is
// guaranteed to remain available until the next read operation is issued.
//
// Error handling:
// ---------------
// A failed read / write will eventually return a failure status code. This
// should include the case when the USB connection drops unexpectedly. However,
// in such circustances the client typically know about this directly from the
// USB layer and thus abort any ongoing operations.
// Once the connection is restored, this layer can be restored to its initial
// state by calling ADBPacketReset().
//
// Important note:
// ---------------
// The USB layer does not handle transmision of ROM buffers. Do not pass ROM
// buffers as packet data. When defining an array as const, the compiler
// typically stores it in ROM, so a possible workaround is to define it as non-
// const, even if it does not change.
//
// Send usage example:
// -------------------
// char hostname[] = "host::";
// ADBPacketReset();
// ...
// ADBPacketSend(ADB_CNXN, ADB_VERSION, ADB_PACKET_MAX_RECV_DATA_BYTES, hostname, sizeof hostname);
// do {
//   ADBPacketTasks();
// } while (ADBPacketSendStatus() == ADB_RESULT_BUSY);
//
// Receive usage example:
// ----------------------
// UINT32 cmd, arg0, arg1, data_len;
// void* data;
// ADBPacketReset();
// ...
// ADBPacketRecv();
// do {
//   ADBPacketTasks();
// } while (ADBPacketRecvStatus(&cmd, &arg0, &arg1, &data, &data_len) == ADB_RESULT_BUSY);
// ... do something with the command ...
