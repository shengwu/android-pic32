Android PIC communication demos
===============================

Example showing how to pass strings back and forth:
- Android application in `applications/String Passing Demo`
- PIC32 firmware in `firmware/String Passing Demo`

Example showing how to access Android GPS, camera, microphone, and touchscreen sensor data:
- Android application in `applications/Android Sensor Demo`
- PIC32 firmware in `firmware/Android Sensor Demo`

These examples were developed using the Microchip C32 compiler v2.0.2. Unfortunately, the code must to be tweaked to be compiled with the XC32 compiler series.
